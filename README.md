## Description

This program is designed to track colors, and remove those colors with a weird, TV-like pattern of random lines and colors, creating a feeling of revealing a digital world underneath the picture on your screen.

To use the program, simply click anywhere on the screen to set the active color. That will be the targeted color to be tracked, within a certain tolerance.

This project came about mostly by accident, as a result of messing around to try and create an 'image' below the camera that would be revealed through tracking. However, I believe this result is much more compelling and unique than that project would have been. I think the selectivity you get from tracking only certain colors when combined with the weird, trippy color effect creates an interesting feeling – that there is data underneath the webcam picture, but that it only has to exist in certain pockets. Specifically, when you track yourself, you become the data-it's a digital metamorphosis of yourself. It's a personal removal and surrender to the weird TV world hiding inside all of or computers.

Going along with this TV theme, and also working within the limitations of my computer's webcam, I decided to present this project in fullscreen using a distinctly CRT-shaped frame around the webcam picture – not only does this I think help make the small picture size feel maximal and enveloping, but it feels authentic to me, like a banged up VHS tape or crappy antenna signal.
